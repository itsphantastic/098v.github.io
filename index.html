							<p>I've been overweight my entire adult life. Once I started nearing 50, after many "diets", I was ready to give up. Then I remembered that a few years back, I had started a low-carb lifestyle.</p>
							<p>I did lose about 15 pounds and felt better, but I eventually went back to my old ways and packed those 15 pounds right back on. I was unhappy and felt terrible every day. I didn't have any other health issues but was resigned to the fact that I'd be overweight for the rest of my life.<br><br>

In May of this year (2017) I finally decided to do something about it once and for all. On May 7th, 2017 I started eating low-carb again. I loved it! I was never hungry and I was starting to feel better. After much research I decided to go even lower-carb and found Keto! I couldn't be happier.</p>

							<p>I am a 34 year old mother of 3 little people. I work full time, and lately have been struggling to to control my eating habits. Despite working out quite often (and enjoying it), I tend to turn to food for comfort and just out of boredom, which has caused me to almost binge at times.
							</p>

							<p>I have never had a problem with this in the past, but my husband is currently in residency with one more year, and even though I don't really feel stressed out often, I think I tend to overeat at night because he's not home quite often, and it just makes me feel better in the moment. I know that I have to get a handle on my eating habits, especially because diabetes and heart disease is on both sides of my family, and because I need to be healthy in order to keep up with my little ones!<br><br>

Since having my middle child, I have also struggled with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and arthritis in my hands, and have had several rounds of injections along with surgery on one hand. I have tried keto on and off since the beginning of this year, and noticed that everything feels so much better, and I just feel lighter, but then I go back to my old eating habits. I don't want that this time around!</p>

											I joined this challenge for so many reasons:<br><br>

1. Due to genetics, I am predisposed to heart disease and diabetes, but I enjoy my husband and children way to much to be set back by an illness if I can help it. I have read so many life changing results from people who adhere to a ketogenic diet, and I would like to give myself every opportunity possible to have a happy and healthy life.
<br><br>
2. My relationship with food has taken a turn for the worse lately, and I know it can and should be better. I feel terrible when I have a large amount of carbs, but it's so hard to ignore the cravings. In the past when I have tried keto, I realize that the cravings eventually subside, and then sweets taste almost too sweet if I do have something. For the work and effort that I put in at the gym, I should definitely see changes in my body, but that is impossible because every weekend I get setback my making terrible food choices. This has to change!
<br><br>
3. I not only want to be healthy, but I want to feel the benefits as well. I can always tell when I haven't been eating well because my joints are stiff and painful, but when I adhere to a good diet and make healthy food choices, I am pretty much pain free. I want to feel this way 100% of the time! Joining this challenge will hold me accountable for the choices I make, as well as help me to track my weight and progress. I really look forward to seeing the end results, AND continuing to make healthy food choices once it's over.
<br><br>
4. My honeymoon is in October... need I say more?! My husband and I got married while he was in medical school, and started working on our family shortly after, so we never got a chance to go on a honeymoon. We finally are this year, and I keep telling him that I will have my beach body ready! That should be enough motivation for me!

											This challenge has helped me to better manage my cravings for sugary foods, given me motivation to get to the gym even when I don't necessarily feel like it, and has allowed me to challenge myself.
<br><br>
Although I did weight myself, I didn't pay too much attention to the numbers because I wanted to focus on building more muscle and getting stronger as well, which makes me feel awesome!
